# Mission-Accepted-Space-Hackathon-2025

## Event Overview
Mission Accepted invites students and early-career professionals to build impactful solutions with Canadian satellite data over an intensive two-day hackathon. Teams will access open- and closed-source datasets, mentorship from industry experts, and technical guidance from ShiftKey Labs, MDA Space, and the Canadian Space Agency.

## Repository Structure
- `Codebase/` — all source code, notebooks, and scripts used to build your solution.
- `Slides/` — presentation deck you will use during demos.
- `Description/` — written documentation (project overview, datasets, architecture, results, future work, team info).

## Submission Workflow
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally and create a feature branch named after your team (for example, `team-aurora/earth-observer`).
3. Populate the three folders with your finalized assets. Keep large files and any closed-source or raw datasets out of the repo unless absolutely required.
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork.
5. Open a pull request (PR) from your fork back to the upstream `Mission-Accepted-Space-Hackathon-2025` repository. If you start the PR as a draft, mark it “Ready for Review” once you are satisfied so judges know it’s final.

## Final Submission Checklist
- `Codebase/` contains reproducible code with setup instructions or scripts where needed.
- `Slides/` includes the presentation deck judges will see.
- `Description/` holds the written documentation bundle (see `Description/overview.md` for quick links, once created).
- All licenses and dataset usage terms are acknowledged where required.
- Any sensitive or proprietary data has been removed.

## Submit to the Organizers
1. Complete the Mission Accepted submission form (link provided by organizers). The form will ask for:
   - Team name, team members, and primary contact email.
   - A short project summary.
   - **Preferred:** URL [https://airtable.com/appkB4tLGaUIf7rIf/pag39Qc7I2IAeGvLR/form](https://airtable.com/appkB4tLGaUIf7rIf/pag39Qc7I2IAeGvLR/form) to your pull request so reviewers can see exactly what changed.
   - **Optional fallback:** URL to your fork’s main branch if the PR is not yet accessible.
2. Ensure the PR and the form are both submitted before the hackathon deadline. The organizers will use the PR link for judging, and the fork link only if the PR cannot be accessed.

## Questions or Support
- Use the event’s Discord server for mentor support.
- Tag the ShiftKey Labs or MDA mentors for dataset or tooling questions.
- For repository access issues, contact the organizing team via the submission form or the designated help desk.

Mission Accepted!
